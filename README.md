According to various research each year millions of students graduate. Some of them go for higher studies, some to other countries and some are ready to enter workplace. So the office bearer / teachers have to manually write the transcripts, maintain hard copies of certificates etc. for important references in admitting to new schools or works. Distribution of certificates is also a problem. Also there is no proper verification of these certificates and marksheets. Counterfeit academic certificates have been a longstanding issue in the academic community. Hence, there is a high need for a mechanism that can guarantee that the information in such a document is original, which means that document has originated from an authorized source and is not fake. In addition, the information in the document should be confidential so that it can only be viewed by authorized person. In order to solve this problem digital certificate systems are introduced. Even though security issues still exist. To solve this issue we can use Blockchain technology the unmodifiable property of the blockchain helps to overcome the problem of certificate forgery.
